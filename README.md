# White Noise Generator -- Android

This is a white noise generator for Android. It uses
[jsyn](http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/) to produce real non-looping white noise
which you can adjust with simple low-pass filters to suit your tastes.

Install via the APK on the releases tab.

This is beta-quality software. It works for me, but your mileage may vary.
